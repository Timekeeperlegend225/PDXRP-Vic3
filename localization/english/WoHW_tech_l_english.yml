 nagan_studies:0 "Nagan Studies"
 nagan_studies_desc:0 "We have started our initial research into the Naga and their ways."
 rural_society:0 "Advanced Agriculture"
 rural_society_desc:0 "The Naga have fairly simple, though ingenius, methods of increasing the efficiency of food crops, cash crops and animal rearing."
 snakeship_tech:0 "Nagan Naval Assets and Strategy"
 snakeship_tech_desc:0 "The Naga make use of their larger reptile cattle as a means of naval power by using them as additional means of propulsion and attack via shackling their warships to their back. Strategically, the Nagan navy works like a snake - seeking to squeeze the life out of an opponent via blockades, convoy raiding, and hit-and-run tactics. We can use these ideas to augment our own forces."
 religious_bureaucracy:0 "Religiously-Integrated Bureaucracy"
 religious_bureaucracy:0 "Through the Nagan priestly and administrative castes being embedded throughout their industrial system and institutions, they apply their strict use of efficiency and interweaving ideology into their bureaucracy. This allows them to reduce workload and ensure that natural changes have a reduced impact on the working of their society."
 nagan_cattle_tech:0 "Nature's Superiority to the Mechanical"
 nagan_cattle_tech_desc:0 "The Naga make significant use of their various reptilian and lizard 'cattle' creatures, which more resemble the sauropods of the far past that we have only begun to understand over the last two centuries. They use them in place of engines, steam-driven systems, and industrial vehicles. We can emulate them by putting these beasts of burden to use in factories, fields and the mines."
 beast_cavalry_tech:0 "Nagan Cattle's Land Military Applications"
 beast_cavalry_tech_desc:0 "The Naga have been observed using their more aggressive reptilian cattle to great effect as mounts for cavalry, where the beasts can attack as well, if not better, than their riders. The use of the more submissive creatures allows them to mobilise and move at higher speeds than horses allow. We shall do the same."
 forced_conversion:0 "Embracing Chakravadah"
 forced_conversion_desc:0 "The religion of Chakravadah is alluring, as it explains so much of life and that all things gain strength through adversity, and we should embrace the opportunity to become more than we are. Those who refuse will see the cost of their ignorance."
 nagan_cattle_fertilizer:0 "Nagan Crop Fertilisation Methods"
 nagan_cattle_fertilizer_desc:0 "These reptilian cattle produce significant quantities of dung, much of it with very high levels of elements useful in crop fertilisation. Rather than leaving it to rot, it should be used to make our fields even more plentiful!"
 goldspear_infantry_tech:0 "Nagan Infantry Weaponry"
 goldspear_infantry_tech_desc:0 "The Nagan 'goldspears', the weapons used by their Nagavanshi infantry forces, are not mystical, but ingenius. They are a long spear which incorporates a powerful rifle system within it, the longer barrel providing heightened accuracy. We can begin using those ideas for our skirmishers to allow them to fire from a greater distance, damaging the morale of the enemy."
 chakravadach_enlightmen:0 "The Spread of Enlightenment"
 chakravadach_enlightmen_desc:0 "The Naga believe strongly in integrating their religious culture into all aspects of life, as well as the importance of education. We can use their example to bring people to our faith, and make access to learning easier for all."
 nagan_cattle_breeding:0 "The Secrets of the Cattle"
 nagan_cattle_breeding_desc:0 "We have managed to aquire, through various means, a sufficient number of the Nagan cattle that we can start our own breeding regime without their assistance. We may need to follow trial and error without their help, but it'll allow us to make greater use of these beasts."
 guerilla_warfare:0 "The Art of Nagan War"
 guerilla_warfare_desc:0 "Our research on Nagan military tactics have shown their significant use of ambushes, hit-and-run tactics, use of terrain and living off the land, which makes getting them into significant engagements difficult. These tactics, though very different to our own, are increasingly useful, and we can apply them to our own military forces."
 baby_and_work:0 "Societal Upbringing"
 baby_and_work_desc:0 "The Naga do not prevent women from participating in social, political or economic areas, and increase the ease on women by providing significant numbers of creches close to their places of work, and all adults will take time to look after children. This has allowed the Naga to both retain a high birth rate and increase the working population by including women. This could be useful to let us increase our population and workforce in a single stroke!"
