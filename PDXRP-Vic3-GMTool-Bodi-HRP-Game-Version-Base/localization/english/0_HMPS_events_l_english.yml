 HMPS_FAQ.3.b:0 "War Support"
 HMPS_FAQ.3.b.t:0 "War support ticks every 28 days rather than 7, resulting in longer wars. Furthermore occupying all of a nation's pops will result in a more rapid drop in WS."
 HMPS_FAQ.3.c:0 "Radicals and Loyalists"
 HMPS_FAQ.3.c.t:0 "Loyalist growth rate has been halved while radical growth rate has been reduced by a third. As a result radicals grow relatively faster than in vanilla. This is largely because of an exploit where unlimited loyalists were possible."
 HMPS_FAQ.4.t:0 "Diplomacy FAQ"
 HMPS_FAQ.4.d:0 "There are not that many changes to diplomacy, however due to the limitations of modding diplomacy in Vic3, there are some confusing changes if not explicitly stated."
 HMPS_FAQ.4.a:0 "Diplomatic Demands"
 HMPS_FAQ.4.a.t:0 "We have attempted to remove Ban Slavery and Regime Change as they are memey, extremely exploitable, and have little non-LARP value. Unfortunately we only partially succeeded. While these war goals were removed from the code and cannot be used to declare war, they can somehow still be added after the diplo play begins. This is unable to be removed so we have banned doing this in our games. We recommend doing the same."
 HMPS_FAQ.4.b:0 "Defeat Modifiers"
 HMPS_FAQ.4.b.t:0 "We have made the Open Market modfiier much harsher, debuffing authority, IG approval, and legitimacy. Open Market also lasts 10 years in full, not 5 years decaying."

 HMPS_FAQ.5.a:0 "OOS Protocol"
 HMPS_FAQ.5.a.t:0 "If a player OOSes, tell them to ignore the warning and drag it off to the side. Do not click either button. Do not leave the game until you see phantom civil wars or are unable to click events."
 HMPS_FAQ.5.b:0 "Last-Player OOS"
 HMPS_FAQ.5.b.t:0 "The last player to join a game (after the first session) has an extremely high chance to OOS."
 HMPS_FAQ.5.c:0 "Rehosting"
 HMPS_FAQ.5.c.t:0 "Rehosting is generally not necessary. Only rehost if almost everyone OOSes or keeps crashing, only then rehost. Sometimes there is an issue with the save and the best way to proceed is to simply force your way through it and temporarily kick the players who are having the worst issues."
 HMPS_FAQ.5.e:0 "Keybinds mods"
 HMPS_FAQ.5.e.t:0 "If you in SP and are confused about why the spacebar and number row has been disabled, then 1) read the Steam page! and 2) download the keybinds mod. The keybinds mod changes your checksum so remember to turn it off when you're re-enter MP."
 HMPS_FAQ.5.g:0 "Game Rules"
 HMPS_FAQ.5.g.t:0 "A link to game rules can also be found on the Steam page -- this page might be outdated so it is also adviseable to check the HMPS Discord."
