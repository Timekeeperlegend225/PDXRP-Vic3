#   GREY - MOD COMPATIBILITY SCRIPTED TRIGGERS   #
##################################################

# You can use these triggers to see if one of my mods is active in a playset.
# This is useful if you want your mod to interact with one of these.

# You can use them by adding a scripted_trigger_file in your mod that you use to enable/disable things.
# You need to create a file, and the File Name should start with "00_", so that it gets loaded before my actual active trigger files.
# Add this to your file (without the "#" obviously, and replacing XXX with the mod you want to reference from below):

#Grey_XXX_is_active = {
#	always = no
#}

# Now you can use this trigger you've made in your mod like this: "Grey_XXX_is_active = yes".
# If that mod is active then my Trigger will take priority and it will result in a "yes".
# If my mod is not active your Trigger will be used and the Trigger will return "no".

}
